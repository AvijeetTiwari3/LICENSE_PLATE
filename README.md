# Vehicle Number Plate Recognition

This project automatically detects and recognizes vehicle number plates from videos using Computer Vision and OCR techniques.  
It takes a video as input, detects the license plate frame-by-frame, extracts the plate region, and recognizes the text.

# Features
- Detects vehicle number plates in video frames  
- Reads plate text using OCR  
- Works on different types of number plates  
- Uses deep learning for accurate detection  
- Processes video and shows real-time results  



# Tech Stack
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- YOLO (Number Plate Detection)  
- EasyOCR   
- NumPy
